# exploring-recipes-and-ratings
Thie is an exploratory data analysis project for DSC80 at UCSD.

My dataset is called recipes and ratings, which show different features regarding recipes and how users rate them. This dataset can give important insight about what users usually enjoy in a recipe and feedback about the types of recipes they like or dislike.
